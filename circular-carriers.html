            <h1>Circular Carriers Program</h1>

            <p>The <strong>Circular Carriers Program</strong> by <strong>TEACH</strong> (Tanzania Eco-Tech and Conservation Hub) is a shining example of a grassroots circular economy initiative. It was launched in response to the government‚Äôs ban on plastic bags, which posed serious threats to environmental sustainability and public health.</p>

            <h1>üåç A Solution Rooted in Local Resources</h1>
            <p>The bags are made using leftover <strong>brown paper sheets</strong> and a safe, <strong>biodegradable glue derived from wheat flour</strong>. These materials would otherwise be discarded, but through this program, they‚Äôre given a new life ‚Äî turning potential waste into useful, environmentally friendly products.</p>

            <h1>üö¥ Sustainable Delivery, Minimal Footprint</h1>
            <p>To maintain the eco-focus, these biodegradable storage bags are delivered to customers via <strong>bicycle and on foot</strong>, eliminating the emissions associated with motorized delivery. As the project scales, TEACH aims to introduce <strong>e-bikes</strong> to reach more customers efficiently while staying carbon-conscious.</p>

            <h1>üë© Empowering Local Women</h1>
            <p>Currently, around <strong>20 women</strong> are involved in producing and selling these storage bags. The project offers them a source of stable income, skill development, and a sense of purpose. More than <strong>200 customers</strong> ‚Äî including local wholesalers ‚Äî regularly purchase the products, demonstrating strong community demand and economic viability.</p>

            <h1>üîÑ Driving Circularity & Impact</h1>
            <p>This program reflects the core principles of the <strong>circular economy</strong> ‚Äî reducing waste, reusing materials, and regenerating value at every step. It supports:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Waste reduction through upcycling</li>
                <li>Zero-emission delivery systems</li>
                <li>Green jobs and women‚Äôs economic empowerment</li>
                <li>Behavioral change towards sustainable practices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Through simple, low-tech solutions, TEACH is proving that small-scale innovation can have a significant, measurable impact on both people and the planet.</p>
